🏪 Electronics Shop Management System (C++)
📘 Project Overview

This project is a C++ console-based application that simulates an Electronic Shop Management System.
It allows the shop owner to manage various electronic items, such as mobiles, laptops, chargers, and many others.
Customers can buy products with discounts, and the system automatically updates stock quantities and calculates total income.

🎯 Features

✅ Product Management

Add multiple categories of electronic items like:

Mobile Phones

Chargers

Headphones

Phone Cases

Data Cables

Laptops

Televisions

CPUs

Graphics Cards

Monitors

Keyboards

Mouse

Hard Disks

Fans

Coolers

LEDs

Irons

✅ Customer Interaction

Customers can buy items in desired quantities.

System applies a custom discount percentage on each purchase.

Automatically checks if enough stock is available.

✅ Automatic Calculations

Updates product quantity after every purchase.

Calculates total shop income considering discounts.

Displays item details after each transaction.

✅ Error Handling

Checks for invalid quantities (like 0 or negative numbers).

Prevents purchases if stock is insufficient.

🧮 Example Functionality

Add product details (company, model/type, price, and quantity).

Customer purchases an item with a given discount percentage.

System reduces stock and adds the discounted sale amount to total income.

Displays updated item details after purchase.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Concepts Applied:

Classes and Objects

Encapsulation

Static Variables

Function Overloading

Data Management

🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

Use of classes to represent different product types.

Use of functions to handle add, show, and buy operations.

Static variable (totalIncome) to maintain shop earnings globally.

Reusability of code with structured class design.


--Conclusion

The Electronics Shop Management System is a simple C++ project that efficiently manages electronic items, purchases, discounts, and income using OOP concepts. It’s a practical mini project for learning real-world applications of classes, objects, and data handling in C++.
